# brittanymederos-v5
Personal portfolio site

Hosted on GitHub Pages. Need to sign-in as Britt to see the GH pages settings.

Source is a Jekyll site, so need to run `jekyll serve` to build it. 
Will build source into the `_site` directory. 

To deploy, you need to push the `_site` directory only to the `gh-pages` branch.
You can do that with this command: `git subtree push --prefix _site/ origin gh-pages`
