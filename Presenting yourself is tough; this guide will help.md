If you’re paying attention, you know that design isn’t fighting for relevance; it’s part of the foundation for successful ventures. But there’s a tiny problem. The world lacks competent designers who are well-versed in applying their skills to app design. 

Or, *is* that the problem?

We think not. We think there are plenty of designers around the world that get passed over because of the (unintentionally) biased perspectives of people looking to hire designers. 

People looking to hire designers are looking for a quick-win: the pedigree of an excellent visual portfolio with striking, shiny interface design; a massive following on social networks like Twitter, Dribbble, and Behance; the perfectly written blog posts on Medium, read and shared by millions. It’s difficult to blame them. Most are working in high-pressure companies with looming deadlines and mountains of work. Of course they’re looking for the quick-win.

Perspectives are shifting. We’re learning that you can hire talented people all over the world, not just in Silicon Valley. We’re learning that remote teammates can be as effective, if not more-so, than in-person teammates. We’re learning that design is complicated, that you need a variety of skill sets to successfully run through the design process. We’re learning that design isn’t just visual after-polish: it’s research, exploration, prototyping, messaging, communication, and testing.  

But widening perspectives is slow. We can’t afford to wait for people hiring designers to change. That’s why we wrote this book. Being active in the community on both the “looking for a job” and “looking to hire” sides has revealed where the mismatch happens.

Our goal is to teach you, the designer, how to present yourself to people looking to hire. From navigating industry titles to talking about your work, we think we’ve got a clear enough picture to be useful. We certainly don’t know everything, but we know enough to set you in the right direction, and give you the fuel to continue moving forward to find a great match for both you and the people you could be helping.

Let’s get started now.
