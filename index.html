    <h1>Brittany Mederos</h1>
    <p class="subheader">Focusing on the user, one problem at a time</p>
    <p>I’m currently a lead interaction designer at <a target="_blank" href="http://elementum.com">Elementum SCM</a>, an enterprise software startup focused on “Making supply chain simple”. Every day I work closely with product managers, stakeholders, and engineering teams to design useful, usable interfaces for logistics managers in Fortune 500 companies across mobile, web, and large-screen displays.</p>

    <p>I fight for the user, continuously striving to inspire empathy and the creation of meaningful applications and interactions. I love to bring my team members together and go through design explorations, incorporating them in the design process. I’ve found this type of collaboration is the best path to create innovative solutions that solve not-so-obvious problems.</p>

    <p>When I’m not designing I enjoy teaching others who are interested in design through the meetup group <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/designers-hearth-mountain-view/">Designer’s Hearth Mountain View</a> I helped co-start. Or you can <a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com/p/rNisjOEChM/?taken-by=brimederos">find me climbing</a> at the local Planet Granite climbing gym.</p>
